[Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/)
is an SDK that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) like
[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction),
[Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service),
and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
with conventional programming languages like C#, Python, and Java. Semantic Kernel achieves this
by allowing you to define [plugins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/plugins)
that can be chained together
in just a [few lines of code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/chaining-functions?tabs=Csharp#using-the-runasync-method-to-simplify-your-code).

What makes Semantic Kernel _special_, however, is its ability to _automatically_ orchestrate
plugins with AI. With Semantic Kernel
[planners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/planner), you
can ask an LLM to generate a plan that achieves a user's unique goal. Afterwards,
Semantic Kernel will execute the plan for the user.

- implementations of those abstractions for services from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction), [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), local models, and more, and for a multitude of vector databases, such as those from [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/getting-started), [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/), [Milvus](https://milvus.io/), and [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search)
- a common representation for [plugins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/plugins), which can then be orchestrated automatically by AI
- the ability to create such plugins from a multitude of sources, including from OpenAPI specifications, prompts, and arbitrary code written in the target language
- extensible support for prompt management and rendering, including built-in handling of common formats like Handlebars and Liquid
- and a wealth of functionality layered on top of these abstractions, such as filters for responsible AI, dependency injection integration, and more.

Semantic Kernel is utilized by enterprises due to its flexibility, modularity and observability. Backed with security enhancing capabilities like telemetry support, and hooks and filters so you’ll feel confident you’re delivering responsible AI solutions at scale.
Semantic Kernel was designed to be future proof, easily connecting your code to the latest AI models evolving with the technology as it advances. When new models are released, you’ll simply swap them out without needing to rewrite your entire codebase.

> we're working on some features still - these will come into the repo soon. We are
> also actively working on improving the code quality and developer experience,
> and we appreciate your support, input and PRs!

> ℹ️ **NOTE**: This project is in early alpha and, just like AI, will evolve quickly.

**Semantic Kernel (SK)** is a lightweight SDK enabling integration of AI Large
Language Models (LLMs) with conventional programming languages. The SK extensible
programming model combines natural language **semantic functions**, traditional
code **native functions**, and **embeddings-based memory** unlocking new potential
and adding value to applications with AI.

SK supports
[prompt templating](docs/PROMPT_TEMPLATE_LANGUAGE.md), function
chaining,
[vectorized memory](docs/EMBEDDINGS.md), and
[intelligent planning](docs/PLANNER.md)
capabilities out of the box.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/371009/221739773-cf43522f-c1e4-42f2-b73d-5ba84e21febb.png)

Semantic Kernel is designed to support and encapsulate several design patterns from the
latest in AI research, such that developers can infuse their applications with complex
[skills](docs/SKILLS.md) like [prompt](docs/PROMPT_TEMPLATE_LANGUAGE.md) chaining,
recursive reasoning, summarization, zero/few-shot learning, contextual memory,
long-term memory, [embeddings](docs/EMBEDDINGS.md), semantic indexing, [planning](docs/PLANNER.md),
and accessing external knowledge stores as well as your own data.

By joining the SK community, you can build AI-first apps faster and have a front-row
peek at how the SDK is being built. SK has been released as open-source so that more
pioneering developers can join us in crafting the future of this landmark moment
in the history of computing.

## Get Started with Semantic Kernel ⚡

Here is a quick example of how to use Semantic Kernel from a Python script.

1. Clone the repo and install SK dependencies, e.g. using `pip install -r python/requirements.txt`
2. Create a new Python file and add the code below.
3. Copy and paste your OpenAI **API key** in the script
   (support for Azure OpenAI is work in progress).
4. Using Python 3.8 or later, run the code. Enjoy!

```python
import sys
sys.path.append("./python")  # nopep8
import semantic_kernel as sk
import asyncio


kernel = sk.create_kernel()

kernel.config.add_openai_completion_backend(
    "davinci",
    "text-davinci-003",
    "...OpenAI Key...")

sk_prompt = """
{{$input}}

Give me the TLDR in 5 words.
"""

tldr_function = sk.extensions.create_semantic_function(
    kernel,
    sk_prompt,
    max_tokens=200,
    temperature=0,
    top_p=0.5)

text_to_summarize = """
    1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction,
    allow a human being to come to harm.

    2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where
    such orders would conflict with the First Law.

    3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection
    does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
"""

summary = asyncio.run(kernel.run_on_str_async(text_to_summarize, tldr_function))

print(f"Output: {summary}")

# Output: Robots must not harm humans.
```

## How does this compare to the main C# branch?

Refer to the [FEATURE_PARITY.md](python/FEATURE_PARITY.md) doc to see where
things stand in matching the features and functionality of the main SK branch.
